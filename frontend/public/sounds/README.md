# Game sounds

The app uses these WAV files (generated by `npm run generate-sounds`):

- **explosion.wav** – hit / cannon shot (~1.5 s)
- **water-splash.wav** – miss / water plop (~0.9 s)
- **ship-sunk.wav** – ship sunk (~1.9 s)

## Using real royalty-free samples

For a more cinematic, realistic feel you can replace the generated files with real recordings:

1. **Explosion (hit)**  
   - Search: “explosion”, “cannon”, “war explosion”, “movie explosion”  
   - Look for: deep bass, 1–1.5 s, natural reverb, no metallic ring  
   - Save as: `explosion.wav` (or keep as MP3 and update `gameSounds.ts` to load it)

2. **Water (miss)**  
   - Search: “water drop”, “plop”, “water splash”, “stone in water”  
   - Look for: single drop, 0.8–1 s, clean, close-mic, no reverb  
   - Save as: `water-splash.wav`

3. **Ship sunk** (optional)  
   - Search: “big explosion”, “distant explosion”  
   - Save as: `ship-sunk.wav`

Place the files in this folder (`frontend/public/sounds/`) with the names above. Use WAV or MP3; the browser decodes both. If you use MP3, update the file extension in `frontend/src/utils/gameSounds.ts` (SOUND_URLS). No other code change needed.
